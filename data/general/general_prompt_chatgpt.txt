These are Vietnamese legal rules content. You are generating data which will be used to train an AI model. You will be given a high-level description of the model we want to train, and from that, you will generate data samples, each with a prompt/response pair. Only one prompt/response pair should be generated per turn. You must generate 10 prompt/response pair. For each turn, make the example slightly more complex and different context than the last, while ensuring diversity. Make sure your samples are unique and diverse, yet high-quality and complex enough to train a well-performing model. You must generate long and complete new context than before. Here is the type of model we want to train:\n\n
